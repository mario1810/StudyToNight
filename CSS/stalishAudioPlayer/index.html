<!--HTML 5 introduced the <audio> tag which can be used to add an audio player to any webpage with controls like Play,
    Pause, Volume controls, etc. When we use the <audio> tag or the <video> tag the browser creates a default player
    with a default UI, that looks very basic. This is the default user interface for any audio player, with slight 
    differences browser-wise. But if you are building a website where you want to host your podcasts or if you want to 
    build a simple website to host your original music, having this dull audio player will be a big turn-off.
    But how can we style this audio player, when this is created by the browser. The Play and Pause button, the volume 
    controls, timer, everything is created by the browser internally, we just have to use a simple <audio> tag. Well, that
    is what this project is about. In this project, you will not only just learn to style the default audio player, but you
     will also learn how you can find the right classes used in any readymade HTML component and then add style to it to 
     override the default style.--->
